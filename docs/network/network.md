# Network

## 1. Network Topology

Network is the basis of the whole IT infrastructure. We can not imagine the situation without network.

IP Addresses reserved for use on private networks

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Class A" content="10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255" %}

{% include alert.html type="primary" title="Class B" content="172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255" %}

{% include alert.html type="secondary" title="Class C" content="192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255" %}

### 1.1 Choosing private IPv4 address

1. We need to reserve enough IP address for all devices (Desktop, Laptop, Mobile, etc), Class A may be good choose. 

2. Pay attention to potential IP confiction in your environment (Docker may use IP address of Class B, etc).

### 1.2 Example of a company with three Offices

```bash
Beijing Office 10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0
Shanghai Office 10.20.0.0/255.255.0.0
Shenzhen Office 10.30.0.0/255.255.0.0
```

### 1.3 Example of Beijing office

```bash
Windows Server 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0 (Available IP address 10.10.10.1 - 10.10.10.254)
Linux Server 10.10.20.0/255.255.254.0 (Available IP address 10.10.20.1 - 10.10.21.254)
```
